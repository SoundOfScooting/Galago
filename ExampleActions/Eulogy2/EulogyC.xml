<!-- eulogy trace starts
if logs removed, good! crash node and give flag.
if logs not removed and disconnect, lock PC.
make sure eulogy pc's are progress ONLY: since i cant remove admin, starting eulogy again is
onconnect based, meaning the player should have admin when they reconnect so they dont die.

if you dont want this to happen, simply execute a seperate eulogy file with a longer time. -->
